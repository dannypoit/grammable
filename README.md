## Users

Use the 'Sign up' and 'Sign in' links at the top right to create a user and log into it. Creating a user will allow you to create new posts (called "grams"), edit your existing grams, and comment on grams. Once you are signed in, you will see a greeting with your login at the top of the page. Grams will display on the page sorted by the date they were posted.

## Create a gram

To create a gram, click 'New Gram' from the top right. Then, enter a message and choose the image file you want to upload, then click 'Post!' For grams you have created, you will also see 'Edit' and 'Delete' links that will allow you to manage your grams.

## Comments

To add a comment to a gram, scroll to the box beneath the gram. Type your comment into the text field, then click 'Add Comment'. Your comment will be displayed, along with any other comments that have been added to that gram.

## RSpec

This application has been developed with Test-Driven Development using RSpec. To run all tests, once you have cloned the repository to your local environment and installed all gems, run the following command:

```ruby
bundle exec rspec
```
